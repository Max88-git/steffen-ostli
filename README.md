## Overview

### The purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a minimalist CSS grid portfolio site for a photographer I follow and who's work I admire. This was a passion project and my first experience working with a CSS grid gallery. I learnt how to create multiple pages with site navigation menus using the nav element. I discovered how to link between pages using a simple anchor tag with href attrribute so when clicked it would display the About or Contact page.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learnt

* How to use HTML and CSS to create a portfolio website.
* Create multiple pages with a navigation menu using anchor elements.
* I learn't how to make a hamburger menu to make the site responsive.
* Add absolute and relative links.
* Add images and unordered lists.
* How to structure and format the page.
* Use link elements to reference an external style sheet.

Here are some code snippets I am proud of:

```css
/* Grid with align-items value of stretch */
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(400px, 1fr));
	grid-gap: 30px;
	align-items: stretch;
	padding-top: 85px;
	margin: 0px 30px 30px 30px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Creating Multiple Pages](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/building-layouts-preprocessors/multi-page-html-sites) - This was useful in understanding how to create and structure multi-page HTML sites.
- [Responsive Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMTs8tAapnQ) - This tutorial taught me how to take a normal navigation and make it responsive with breakpoints using media queries.
